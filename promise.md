# Security Notice
I promise to never use my private key associated with real money in plain text ðŸ˜Ž
I am currently using a `$PRIVATE_KEY` in my `.env` file, which is cool ðŸ˜Ž as far as I do not expose my `.env` file
But for security purposes, I will use `--interactive`, or a keystore file when Foundry adds that feature
I will also check out thirdweb deploy
